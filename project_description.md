Recipe App

 I am going to Build a simple app that lets user upload and share food recipes.
it will include a small portion of java script . here is the flow of the app in steps

1, user will enter the app.
2, to post a recipe, he is redirected to login page, if he is not a member then he is redirected to registration page.
3, Here in both the forms, validation process is done through java script, to see whether the values are valid or not.
For example, if user is entering integer values into the name field then a popup pops up to warn him that you are entering a wrong value and moreover , it doesnot let the user to move through to enter next value in next element until this value doesnot get corrected.
4, later on login user and password pair are found to have a match and the user logs in.
5, then to post a reciepe , a user has to click on post and then he is again redirected to a form where he can post an image , description and various factors about his receipe.
6, all the values are validated through javascript to have valid values and post is posted only when then all the values are validated appropriately.
7, then these values can be seen in the gallery of reciepies.
